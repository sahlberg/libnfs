BUGS

Fix NULL pointer crash in nfs_link().

Clamp read/write size for servers (Ganesha) that offer very large io sizes
instead of failing to connect to the export.

Double free fix: don't call rpc_free_pdu() after rpc_queue_pdu() failure.

Fix for memory leak in rpc_allocate_*().

Fixes to build nfs-ls and nfs-cp on win32.

Abort the mount process correctly if MOUNT/MNT returns error or is cancelled.

Fix memory leak in error path in nfs_create_2_cb().

Fix leak of rpc->inbuf if we destroy the context while we still have PDUs
in flight.
