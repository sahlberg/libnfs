LIBNFS is a client library for accessing NFS shares over a network.

LIBNFS offers three different APIs, for different use :
1, RAW : A fully async low level rpc library for nfs protocols
This API is described in include/libnfs-raw.h
it offers a fully async interface to raw XDR encoded blobs.
This api provides very flexible and precice control of the RPC issued.

examples/nfsclient-raw.c provides examples on how to use the raw API

2, NFS ASYNC : A fully asynchronous library for high level vfs functions
This API is described by the *_async() fucntions in include/libnfs.h.
This API provides a fully async access to posix vfs like functions such as 
stat(), read(), ...

examples/nfsclient-async.c provides examples on how to use this API


3, NFS SYNC : A synchronous library for high level vfs functions
This API is described by the *_sync() fucntions in include/libnfs.h.
This API provides access to posix vfs like functions such as 
stat(), read(), ...

ROOT vs NON-ROOT
================
When running as root, libnfs tries to allocate a system port for its connection
to the nfs server. When running as non-root it will use a normal 
ephemeral port.
Many NFS servers default to a mode where they do not allow non-system
ports from connecting.
These servers require you use the "insecure" export option in /etc/exports
in order to allow libnfs clients to be able to connect.

PLATTFORM support
=================
As of now this is tested with linux, MacOSX and Apple iOS.

Linux:  - tested with Ubuntu 10.04 - should work with others aswell
MacOSX: - tested with SDK 10.4 (under Snow Leopard) - should also work with later SDKs and 64Bit
iOS:    - tested with iOS SDK 4.2 - running on iOS 4.3.x
